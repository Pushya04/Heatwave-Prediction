MACHINE LEARNING-BASED HEATWAVE PREDICTION AND EXPLAINABLE AI ANALYSIS
PROJECT ABSTRACT

Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for heatwave prediction using global temperature data. We explore challenges associated with large-scale climate datasets, including data extraction complexity, spatial-temporal dependencies, and model interpretability requirements. The study emphasizes a multi-model ensemble approach applied to the Berkeley Earth Global 1-degree gridded temperature dataset, coupled with advanced Explainable AI (XAI) techniques using SHAP analysis. 

The methodology encompasses preprocessing global temperature data through areal weighting and climatology computation, engineering temporal features including day-of-year cyclical encoding, implementing seven distinct machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, MLP, MLP Ensemble, and AdaBoost+MLP Regressor), conducting rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, and deploying comprehensive XAI analysis for model interpretability. 

Key innovations include successfully extracting and processing the massive Berkeley Earth dataset (423 MB NetCDF file with global coverage), implementing area-weighted sampling to account for geographical representation, creating a hybrid regression-classification approach (ML7) that predicts future temperatures and derives heatwave classifications, and applying SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to all seven models for complete transparency and interpretability.

Results demonstrate exceptional performance across all models. The best-performing model (ML7 - AdaBoost+MLP) achieved 97.34% classification accuracy, 91.29% precision, 93.53% recall, and 92.40% F1-score for heatwave detection, while maintaining R²=0.9926 and MAE=0.99°C for temperature regression. The ensemble approaches (ML2-XGBoost and ML6-MLP Ensemble) achieved high ROC-AUC scores of 98.73% and 97.96% respectively, demonstrating robust probabilistic predictions. Traditional models (ML1-Random Forest: 92.20% accuracy, ML3-Logistic Regression: 88.42% accuracy) provided strong baseline performance, while the calibrated SVM (ML4) achieved the highest precision (98.79%) at the cost of recall.

XAI analysis revealed critical insights through SHAP visualizations. Feature importance analysis across all models consistently identified temperature_celsius, climatology, and temperature_anomaly as the top three predictors. Permutation importance validated these findings with model-agnostic feature ranking. SHAP summary plots demonstrated that higher temperatures, positive anomalies, and seasonal patterns (doy_sin, doy_cos) strongly drive heatwave predictions. SHAP force plots provided individual prediction explanations, showing how each feature contributed to specific heatwave classifications. Geographical features (latitude, longitude) and temporal lags (temp_anom_prev_day, temp_anom_diff_1d) exhibited moderate but consistent influence across models.

Comprehensive visualizations, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, feature importance plots, SHAP summary plots, SHAP bar charts, force plots, and decision plots, provide complete insights into model performance and prediction mechanisms. Cross-validation analysis demonstrated consistency across folds, with the hybrid regression model (ML7) showing superior generalization capabilities.

This work advances climate prediction by implementing a complete pipeline from raw global climate data extraction through model deployment and interpretability analysis. The integration of diverse machine learning architectures with rigorous XAI techniques offers a robust, transparent, and production-ready framework for operational heatwave early warning systems. The project successfully addresses the critical challenge of making black-box machine learning models interpretable for climate science applications, where stakeholder trust and regulatory compliance demand full transparency in prediction mechanisms.
